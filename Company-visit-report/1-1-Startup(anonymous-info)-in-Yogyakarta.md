ICT business is important for Jogja economy, occupied over than a half of GRP according to statics data in Yogyakarta, 2017.


According to an interview in an anonymous Start-up company, "Indonesian development is supported by ICT solutions."


The company has HQ in Yogyakarta, the city of study in Indonesia, and welcomes many university students to internship.
I met about 6 of them, and study programming for weeks. The main programming language in Indonesia is PHP. Others are also used,
but less popular because both of developers and clients aren't interested in other languages' cost-performance in this country.


## Indonesia got popularity because of its originality and economic potential
First to say, Indonesia has huge population and also huge market. Therefore, Indonesia is estimated as 16th biggest economic power in the world.
With various culture and various social custom, Indonesia is making the best use of its potential power in ICT industry.


For example, online car booking services and sightseeing information services are popular in Indonesia. Jakarta(Jawa), Yogyakarta(Jawa), Denpasar(Bali) and other cities have various APP services for sightseeing.
Then, high-quality programming education is needed for its constant development. As explained in a series of No.1-No.5 documents, there are many schools educating engineers.
As we know, software development projects depend on cost-performance. In developed countries, especially Japan, want to order off-shore development for their projects.


PHP-based Web applications are main products made in Indonesia. Different from China and Vietnam, there are less Python engineers, for instance, then standard cost of "Python development project" is comparatively higher than the one of PHP.
The biggest and most important market in Indonesia is smartphone APP market because 65 % of Indonesian population uses internet through smartphones.


### Orang Indonesia terbuka hadap perkembangan (Indonesian people are opened to development)
This character of Indonesian people is important to explain ICT business environment in Indonesia. Indonesians love shopping and sightseeing, and foreigners also want to enjoy their trip there.
Because of this, Go-jek and Tokopedia, most famous online services in Indonesia, has being developed constantly.
