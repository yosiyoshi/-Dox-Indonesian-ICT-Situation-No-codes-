Lippo group, one of Indonesian biggest group whose business spread across whole Asia, invested 44 million dollar in Chinese tech group Tencent(腾讯) in June 26, 2018.
This event is meaning the presence of more Indonesian investment in China. Lippo plaza, shopping malls owned by Lippo group, started business in Shanghai under the name of 
"力宝广场 (Zh. Lippo plaza)" in 2011. Lippo group itself is also built by an oversea-Chinese scourer of China and Indonesia. This historical and commercial relationship between two countries is important to understand Chinese presence in Indonesia.
