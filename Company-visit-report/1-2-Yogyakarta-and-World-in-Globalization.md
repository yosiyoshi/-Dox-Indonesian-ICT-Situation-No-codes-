## 1-2.Yogyakarta and the World in Globalization
According to the company of start-up that I visited again in Yogyakarta, there is interesting knowledge about globalization.


The existing of off-shore development demand from abroad, e.g. Australia, France, Japan, Singapore and Vietnam is remarkable in Yogyakarta city.
So we can say they're interested in Indonesian high-quality human resources for ICT industry with low cost. Indonesia has huge market with huge population, so domestic demand is also lucretive.
Airports, mosques, hotels and pasars, there are uncountable place to attract people's attention, and if put some attraction there, it'll make difference in marketing from the point of view, advertising.


### Orang Indonesia suka berbelanja. (Indonesian people love shopping.)
This is important character of Indonesian people. Gramedia book shop, Lippo Mall of Lippo Group etc are biggest and most popular shopping site in Indonesia.


According to "List by the International Monetary Fund (estimates for 2017)" and "List by the World Bank (2017)" from Wikipedia.org, Indonesia is listed as 7th biggest PPP power.
So, the trait of Indonesian people is also attested from the view of Economy. Then, the cost of human resources is more attractive because they can invest for Indonesia to hire low-cost high-quality labour also to develop their business there.
As the result, strong PPP and low-cost labour market, large population, and domestic demand from market made Indonesia strong in economy.


Also from academism, Indonesia has strong power in software-engineering. Universities in Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Malang, Surabaya and Bali are especially spotlighted by ICT industry there.
PHP and Java are most popular, therefore much labour power is existing in Web- and Mobile- Apps.


Compared from Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam: PPP for domestic economy influences well.


As the conclusion, Indonesia also has huge resources in various industries, and industrial infrastructure-facilities. Primary-, secondary- and tertiary secter of industry made good balance.
