## 4. How Indonesia 4.0 Works


Joko Widodo cabinet planed Indonesia 4.0 and lead the initiative. National High-Tech industries in Indonesia are subsidazed by the government.


### Present situation seen from the point of view: "Business Resource"


Since "Indonesia 4.0" imitated German industrial development plan called "Industrie 4.0", it's expected to encourage the development automation systems in Indonesia.
However, it means that such systems can replace human labour with their themselves.


According to:

"Kementerian Ketenagakerjaan (Ministry of Human Resources, abb. Kemnaker)" stated that "4th Industrial Revolution can replace 50 percent of workers (in Indonesia),"
because there are only 12 percent of total worker population in Indonesia, those who have "Engineer skills." Others, 88 percent of them are just operators without such skills.


According to Bambang Satrio Lelono, the General Director for Training and Productivity of Kemnaker (Dirjen Pembinaan Pelatihan dan Produktivitas Kemnaker),
"Upskilling or reskilling" is a keyword to ameliorate or pejorate such a low qualification. Especially Engineering and ICT skills are needed for labour in Indonesia.


Thus, higher education in Indonesia has important meaning to educate high-qualified engineers and business officers. There are two High-Tech fields in that Indonesia is efforting:


### Electronic Automobils


### Airplanes

There are two ways to give it certification, but they receipt the certification by "Direktorat Kelaikan Udara dan Pengoperasian Pesawat Udara (DKUPP)." If it goes on next stages successfully, they'll start mass-production in 2019.


As the conclusion, this plan is also aimed to improve the economy of Indonesia to let it enter "the level of developed country."
