Kemampuan Bahasa Inggris di Industri Layanan Indonesisa diukur dengan menggunakan Skala Umum Kerangka Kerja Eropa


By: Ina Sukaesihdan Dedi Junaedi Lecturer of Accountancy Department, PNJ Lecturer of Mechanical Engineering Department, PNJ


Jakarta is the capital of Republik Indonesia, and has many headquaters of ICT companies in Southeast Asia. Since ICT industry belongs to Tertiary Industry, English skill is also needed to communicate with customers and workers.
The thesis researched the present situation of English Skill Level using the Common European Framework Scales.


As the summary of information from the thesis, Indonesian workers' average of English Skill Level is 3.05, the authour appreciated it "not bad."
However, it shows us low performance in writing a certain topic or writing a letter to an editor, the lowest in comprehending and summarizing news content, interview and documentary.
It means that they have weakness in logical thinking about certain topics to be written. This skill may be the most important skill to gather and express information.


This weakness might make many Indonesian workers have difficulty in brainwork for business. Especially Hi-Tech industries need such a skill to discuss topics to develop and improve quality of their works.
Manufature, software engineering, online services, and many other kinds of business need improvement in English logical thinking. Therefore, I think English education is as well important as Technology education.
